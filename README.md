# Melbournefootprint


##  INTRODUCTION
### PRODUCT OVERVIEW
‘Melbourne Footprint’ is an iOS based application that will run in the background of your phone and share information about historical/artistic places around Melbourne using a pop up notification thereby turning a casual stroll into your own self-guided trip. It is a technological platform that will work as an information/travel guide of Melbourne for the tourists (mainly students, artists or backpackers) aged 20-40 years. It will first detect the current location of the user, then show the nearby arts/sculptures and provide directions to them. On clicking the name of the desired arts, the user can view the images as well as the description of those arts. This application will hence replace the expensive tour guides, giving you the ability to do the exploring at your own pace thereby providing them flexibility and independency.

### PURPOSE

The first part of the report provides the schedule of necessary tasks comprising of Product document, Support document and Maintenance document while the second part includes the final handover followed by sign off sheet.

### AUDIENCE
